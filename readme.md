Project made for university, for Algorithm Design and Artificial Intelligence Methods subject

It creates arrays  with sizes of 10000, 50000, 100000, 500000 and 1000000 elements and sorts them in following cases:
-all elements random
-20%, 50%, 75%, 95%, 99%, 99,7% first elements are sorted
-all elements sorted in reverse direction

Pre-sorting is done by std::sort
For each case 100 tests are run whith merge sort, quick sort and introspective sort written by me.
Running times are shown in console, printed from stderr.
